We change that.

At APG, we launch your podcast and then build your brand through our Brand Builder programme. This is not basic editing. It is a full transformation of how your ideas are shaped and presented.

The Brand Builder gives you a clear theme, a defined listener and a cohesive identity across audio, video and visuals. Your episodes become polished, intentional and aligned with your brand.

After launch, we continue refining every episode so your message stays consistent and professional.

**What you receive:**

* Clear theme, listener and message
* Cohesive brand identity
* Polished episode packaging
* Short form clips, trailer and promo assets
* Ongoing brand development each month

We launch your podcast, but the real value is how we build your podcast brand to make an impact over time.

**Disclaimer:**

1 We do not work with everyone only those who align with our values.

2 We only take on 8 new clients per quarter to maintain our obsessive attention to detail.

At APG, we launch your podcast and then build your brand through our Brand Builder programme. This is not basic editing. It is a full transformation of how your ideas are shaped and presented.

The Brand Builder gives you a clear theme, a defined listener and a cohesive identity across audio, video and visuals. Your episodes become polished, intentional and aligned with your brand.

After launch, we continue refining every episode so your message stays consistent and professional.

**What you receive:**

* Clear theme, listener and message
* Cohesive brand identity
* Polished episode packaging
* Short form clips, trailer and promo assets
* Ongoing brand development each month

We launch your podcast, but the real value is how we build your podcast brand to make an impact over time.
