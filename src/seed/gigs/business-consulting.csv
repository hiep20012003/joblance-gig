If you are dreaming of owning your own successful business or side-gig and looking for advice from a successful, independent business owner look no further.

**Don't go all in on an expensive ""coaching"" package.**

That is where you get ripped off paying thousands of dollars up front for an unclear result. These ""coaches"" are usually profiting off of your hopes and dreams. Not me! Sign up for a basic or standard gig and get a taste of what value I can bring. If you find it helpful, sign up for more. No high pressure sales, just some advice from a successful business owner and you pay as you go.

**I am here for you.**

I have worked for fortune 500 companies for 30 years. I have successfully launched businesses and run several non-profit organizations. My current business, Tempest Risk Management, grosses over $100,000 annually with a 40% profit margin....and that is a complete side-gig!!!

If this sounds like you, then this gig is the perfect solution.

I will give you my feedback and together we will discuss ways your business idea and/or business model can be adjusted. (If you don't know the difference between business idea and business model, we will discuss that too).
