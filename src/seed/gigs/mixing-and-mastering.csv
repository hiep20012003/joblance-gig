I'm a professional mastering engineer, and I'll take your work to the next level.

**Why Analog Mastering?**

Since 2011, I've worked in pro studios in London and Berlin.

Let me tell you: nothing beats the warmth that analog masters produce.

All the top professionals in the music industry all rely on analog mastering equipment to achieve truly successful final production masters.

Analog mastering creates more warmth and softer edges on the tone.

If you prefer a perfect sound without any flaws... then digital is the way to go.

However, it is the flaws that often get the people continually interested in something because of its slight unpredictability.

**Let's Get Started!**

My workflow is 100% customized to your needs.

I don't use quick shortcuts: **for a day you'll be my sole client** and I'll work as hard as I can to provide you with an excellent Analog Master and a loud, definite, clear and punchy track.

Message me to start a conversation, and send me your track straight away with enough headroom to work with.

What you will get is a 24bit WAV track and a 320kbit mp3 version (ready for iTunes and digital download).",Professional analog mastering of your song in 24 hours. Delivery in WAV and MP3.,10.0
