Please don't hesitate to **get in touch with me** before ordering to discuss how we can get the most out of working together. I'd like to know what vibe you're shooting for.

I record with electronic drums.That way I can pick a drum sound that fits your song perfectly. For the (acoustic) drum sounds I'm using **EZ Drummer 2 and 3** from Toontrack.

Feel free to ask me any questions directly. If the packages I have available don't fit what you're looking for, we can discuss a custom offer.

As long as I'm drumming, I don't hate any song. I've played in pop/rock bands, Jazz/blues bands, Caribbean bands, and Choirs. So I genuinely have a broad interest in various music styles.

I'm well versed in the following:

- Pop

- R&B/Hip Hop/Rap

- Funk

- Country

- Blues

- Reggae
