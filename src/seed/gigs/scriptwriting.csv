What you get: A video or phone conference to discuss your idea and vision. Consistent updates from me throughout the writing process. Previews of drafts prior to delivery. I offer Milestone workflow options for most projects. Ask about coupons.

I ask for writing credit on anything I do. If you want to hire me as a ghostwriter, someone who writes but does not take credit, my fees double. I will not write religious or politically motivated content.

Hi! I'm HendyK, an industry script reader, editor, and agented screenwriter. My past clients include an Oscar Winner, an Emmy winner, and several production companies in Hollywood.

As a writer, I know what kind of notes are valuable when getting feedback. In the past, I've received notes where the reader has not understood the story or read the material thoroughly. This can be a huge setback in the writing process and often be detrimental to the material.

When you pick my gig, you can trust that I will really dig into your work and give you honest, helpful feedback. My criticisms will be constructive, and not just pointers that are harsh and unusable. By using a scorecard, I'll also evaluate your material against scripts I read on a professional basis. This way, you'll know exactly where your work stands in the market.

The notes will cover:

* Plot/Premise
* Character
* Structure/Writing Style
* Themes
* Dialogue
* Marketability
